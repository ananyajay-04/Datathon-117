## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project analyzes fetal heart rate patterns and uterine contractions to automatically detect potential **fetal distress** using machine learning.

---

## ðŸ§© Steps We Took
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined data distributions, missing values, and outliers.  
2. **Feature Analysis:** Investigated relationships between key fetal and maternal parameters.  
3. **Model Training:** Tested multiple models; Gradient Boosting yielded the best performance.  
4. **Evaluation:** Compared model accuracy and interpretability for clinical relevance.
